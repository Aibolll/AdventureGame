Refactoring the Adventure Game Using SOLID Principles

Introduction

When we first looked at the original Adventure Game code, everything was crammed into a single class, making it hard to read, modify, and extend. To fix this, we applied SOLID principles, breaking the game into smaller, well-organized pieces. This makes it easier to add new features down the line without messing everything up.


How We Applied SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) – Keeping Things Focused
Each class now does just one job, making the code cleaner:
•	Player handles player stats like health, experience, and inventory.
•	EnemyManager takes care of enemies and their interactions.
•	ItemManager deals with item pickups and their effects.
•	LevelManager controls level progression.
•	ScoreManager tracks the player’s score.
•	Game coordinates everything and runs the game loop.
This makes it much easier to tweak or upgrade parts of the game without breaking unrelated stuff.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) – Making It Easy to Expand
We designed the game so that you can add new features without modifying existing code. For example:
•	You can add new enemy types without touching EnemyManager—just create a new class that follows the Enemy interface.
•	You can introduce new items without changing ItemManager; it already works dynamically using a map to apply effects.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) – Making Components Interchangeable
The EnemyManager can work with any class that follows the Enemy interface. This means if we later add a Dragon enemy, we don’t have to change the game logic—just plug it in and go!
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) – Avoiding Bloated Classes
Instead of forcing everything into one big interface, we split responsibilities:
•	EnemyManager doesn’t care about items.
•	ItemManager doesn’t deal with enemies.
•	ScoreManager only tracks points.
This keeps each part of the game clean and easy to understand.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – Reducing Hard Dependencies
Rather than having classes that rely on specific implementations, Game interacts with higher-level abstractions (like EnemyManager and ItemManager). This means if we ever want to swap out how enemies work, we won’t have to rewrite the whole game.

Why This Structure Works
We split up the game into well-organized parts that each do their own job. Now:
1.	Adding new enemies or items is easy. You don’t have to dig into Game to make changes.
2.	The code is more readable. Each part has a clear purpose.
3.	Bugs are easier to track down. If something goes wrong with enemies, you know it’s in EnemyManager, not buried somewhere random.
4.	Future expansion is simple. If we wanted multiplayer, we could just tweak Player and Game without touching anything else.

Final Thoughts
Refactoring the Adventure Game with SOLID principles made it cleaner, more flexible, and easier to work with. Now, if we want to add dragons, magic spells, or even a co-op mode, we can do that without tearing the whole game apart.
